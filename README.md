This classifier as the name suggests classifies between a normal x-ray and pneumonia or tb x-rays. 


The data for this classifier was taken from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset](url) & [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray

The two datasets were combined together so that we can images of both Pneumonia patients as well as TB patients.

Still under Development.......

The app for the same is deployed at huggingface:
