The data for this classifier was taken from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset](url) & [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray

The two datasets were combined together so that we can images of both Pneumonia patients as well as TB patients.

The app for the same is deployed at huggingface:
